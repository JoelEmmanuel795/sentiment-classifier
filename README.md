# sentiment-classifier
This project processes simulated Twitter / X data to classify tweets based on sentiment. Using Python, it calculates positive, negative, and net scores for each tweet based on predefined word lists. The script then outputs a CSV file with these scores, along with the number of retweets and replies for each tweet.
